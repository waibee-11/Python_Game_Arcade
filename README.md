# GameZone - A Game Arcade on Python

This was a project that I made during grade 12 (3 years back but I added it to github recently while switching laptops :)). I used Python3. Specifically, this projects employs concepts like functions, arrays, strings, file management, modules, packages, errors and exceptions. I also created a version with a MySQL database linked to the program to save user login credentials and scores. In this version, I used files to save data.

The arcade, named Game Zone, has 5 games:
1. Tic Tac Toe
2. Hangman
3. Rock-Paper-Scissor
4. Quizzer
5. Number Guesser

When you run the code, you are prompted to login. If you are a new user, you must create your account first. On signing in, you will be greeted to the home screen. There are 4 options:
1. PLAY GAMES
2. CREDITS
3. RECORDS
4. EXIT Game Zone

You have to enter the option number. If you enter 1, you will be taken to another menu with 7 options:
1. Tic Tac Toe
2. Stone Paper Scissor
3. Hangman
4. Quiz Master
5. Mastermind
6.Save and Return to Main Menu
7. Quit without playing

Options 1-5 are for the 5 games. Option 6 is to save your records and quit. Option 7 is used in a scenario where either you haven't started to play a game, or you don't want to save your records.

On entering 6 or 7, you'll be taken back to the Home Screen.

Option 2 on the Home Screen will show you information about the developers (that's me and 2 of my friends).

Option 3 on the Home Screen will show you records of players who have played so far. This involves opening a file and extracting data.

Option 4 is obviously to quit the arcade.
